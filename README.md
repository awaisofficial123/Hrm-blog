Introduction to AI in Human Resource Management

Definition of AI in HR

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Human Resource Management refers to the use of advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate and enhance various HR functions. This includes everything from recruitment and onboarding to performance management and employee engagement.
